📈 Grain News AI

Automated Intelligence Pipeline for Global Grain Markets (Wheat · Corn · Soy)
Real-time news ingestion • LLM analytics • Macro scoring • Price impact estimates • Alerts • Backtesting

⸻

🚀 Overview

Grain News AI is a fully automated intelligence system designed to extract actionable trading signals from global agricultural news flows.

The pipeline ingests multi-language news (EN/FR/ES/PT), parses articles, summarizes them using an LLM, classifies events, computes sentiment & macro scores, generates alerts, quantifies price impact, and produces a complete Daily Grain Intelligence Report with charts.

It also includes a lightweight historical backtester to evaluate the predictive power of generated signals.
